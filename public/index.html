                <h2>How it started :</h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I must confess that I fell on code by accident, previously graduated from College with a
                    Bachelor in Sport and Exercise Sciences thus wanting to work with peoples suffering from
                    disabilities, I couldn't find a job thanks to Covid-19. So I started to learn different stuff while
                    at home and found an online course about HTML & CSS, I was so deeply absorbed by it that I spend 10
                    hours on it without knowing, that's how I knew that I wanted to do that for a living, not by
                    interest like my previous studies but by passion.<br><br>
                    So I participated at an open day in "Up To Fourmies - Grande Ecole du num√©rique"
                    (yup I'm French btw) and get accepted to it, then I validated a Full-stack Web Developer's degree
                    and right now I'm continuing to study here to get a Software Developer's Degree.
